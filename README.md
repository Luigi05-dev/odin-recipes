# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal was to build a basic recipe website using only HTML to practice the fundamentals of website structure and file organisation.

## What the Project Includes

The site contains:
- A main index page that links to three different recipes

- Individual recipe pages with:
- A title
- An image
- A short description
- An ingredients list
- Step-by-step instructions
- A link back to the homepage

## What I Learned
By completing this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Writing clean and structured HTML
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images properly
- Linking pages together using relative file paths
- Organising project directories
- Uploading images to Github correctly
- Using Git for version control with meaningful commit messages
- Publishing a website online using Github pages

This was a good introduction to how real projects are built step by step.
